# 📈 AI in Python – Stock Price Prediction

> Machine learning exploration of stock price prediction using classical ML models and LSTM-based deep learning on historical market data.

---

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **AI in Python** coursework at **The University of Texas at Tyler** and focuses on applying machine learning techniques to **financial time-series data**.

The workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Model experimentation and comparison  
- Performance evaluation on historical stock market data  

The project benchmarks multiple approaches — including **traditional machine learning models** and **deep learning architectures** — against **S&P 500 historical data** sourced from **Yahoo Finance** to assess predictive behavior under real-world market conditions.
